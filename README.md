Random Forward Time Watchface
=============================

The purpose of this watchface is to help the user be more punctual. Every few minutes we generate a random number from the range [0, MAX_MIN_FORWARD] in order to turn forward the watch to a time unknown by the user.

Once the Pebble configuration framework has matured a bit, I'll submit this project to the Pebble Appstore.
